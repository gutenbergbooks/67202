<p class='c006'><i>The occasion for this little volume is the celebration of the
centenary of Whittier’s birth. The sketch of his life aims
to present the chief formative influences which affected
his career and determined the character of his poetry.
The poems have been chosen with the intention of illustrating,
first, the circumstances of Whittier’s boyhood
and the themes to which his poetic imagination naturally
turned, then the political and social struggle which engrossed
so many of his years, and finally that mood of
devout resting and waiting in which his long life closed.</i></p>

    <div>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The loneliness of the homestead in which
Whittier was born, on December 17, 1807, has
been described by the poet himself and emphasized
by his biographers. It is a solitary
spot, even to-day. The farmhouse, built by
the poet’s great-great-grandfather in 1688, has
been preserved by the affectionate solicitude
of the Whittier Homestead Association. After
the ravages of fire and of time it has been
scrupulously restored. The old-fashioned garden,
the lawn sloping to the brook, the very
stepping-stones, the beehives, the bridle-post,
the worn door-stone, the barn across the road,
even the surrounding woods of pine and oak,
are all, as nearly as may be, precisely what
they were a hundred years ago. The shadow
of Job’s Hill still darkens the pleasant little
stream and the narrow meadows of the homestead.
In the dusk of August evenings the
deer come out to feed among the alders. The
neighborhood remains sparsely settled. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>other house is within sight or hearing. Even
in summer the rural quiet is scarcely broken,
and the winter landscape makes an almost
sombre impression of physical seclusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The intellectual isolation of the poet’s youth
has likewise been impressed upon every reader
of “Snow-Bound.” The books in that Quaker
farmhouse were few and unattractive. The
local newspaper came once a week. The teachers
of the district school often knew scarcely
more literature than their scholars. In the
Friends’ meeting-house at Amesbury, which
the Whittiers faithfully attended, there was
little of that intellectual stimulus which the
sermons of an highly educated clergy then offered
to the orthodox. The hour of the New
England lyceum—that curiously effective
though short-lived popular university—had
not yet come. Yet our own generation, bewildered
by far too many newspapers, magazines,
and books, is apt to forget that a few
vitalizing ideas may more than make good the
lack of printed matter. Whittier, who was to
become the poet of Freedom, felt even in boyhood,
in that secluded valley of the Merrimac,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the pulse of the great European movement of
emancipation which has transformed, and is
still transforming, our modern world. “My
father,” he wrote afterwards, “was an old-fashioned
Democrat, and really believed in the
Preamble of the Bill of Rights which reaffirmed
the Declaration of Independence.” In his
poem “Democracy” he reasserts his own and
his father’s faith: —</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, ideal of my boyhood’s time!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The faith in which my father stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even when the sons of Lust and Crime</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had stained thy peaceful courts with blood!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Not even the terrors of the French Revolution,
it seems, could shake the silent John Whittier’s
steadfast belief in the natural rights of man.
He entertained in the old farmhouse William
Forster, the distinguished British advocate of
abolition. He transmitted to his boys a hatred
of “priests and kings” which befitted the descendants
of forbears who had felt the weight
of the displeasure of the Puritan theocracy.
Not that the Whittiers were agitators: they
were taciturn, self-respecting landholders, who—in
the phrase which a famous American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>poet, also of Quaker stock, afterward applied
to himself—wore their hats as they pleased,
indoors and out. But the Whittiers were so
used to quiet independence that it never occurred
to them to brag of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>This moral freedom of the New England
Quakers, touched as it was with the humanitarian
passion of the later eighteenth century,
was the poet’s spiritual heritage. Judged by
material standards, his lot was one of hardship.
The Whittier farm was both rocky and
swampy. Only the most stubborn toil could
wring from it a livelihood. In the harsh labor
of the farm the two boys helped as best they
could, but John Greenleaf was slender and
delicate, and suffered life-long injury by attempting
tasks beyond his strength. The winters
were like iron; underclothing was almost
unknown; the houses were poorly warmed
and the churches not at all; and the food,
in farmers’ homes, lacked variety and was ill-cooked.
Though the poet’s body never recovered
from these privations of his youth, the
sufferings grew light when, in middle and later
life, he weighed them against the happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of home affection and the endless pleasures
of a boy’s life out of doors. “The Barefoot
Boy,” “Snow-Bound,” and “In School-Days”
tell the story more charmingly and with more
truth than it can ever be told in prose. Few
households are better known to American
readers than the inmates of the ancient homestead
under Job’s Hill. In the “Flemish pictures”
of the gifted son we behold the reticent,
laborious father, the benignant mother,—like
Goethe’s mother, a natural story-teller,—the
gracious maiden aunt, the uncle with
his “prodigies of rod and gun,” the grave
elder sister, and the brilliant Elizabeth. These,
with the boyish schoolmaster and the “half-welcome”
casual guest, are still grouped for
us before the great hearth in the ample living-room,
waiting</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Until the old, rude-furnished room</div>
      <div class='line'>Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom;”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>a bloom that never fades from the memory
of the born New Englander. Indeed, such was
Whittier’s fidelity to the impressions made
upon him in his youth, so unerring was his
instinct for what was truly characteristic of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>time and place, that these poems written about
his boyhood portray, with a vividness rarely
equalled in our literature, not only a mode of
outward life, but a type of thought and feeling
which possesses a permanent significance to all
who would understand the American mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was easier for Whittier, after all, to picture
the East Haverhill homestead and its
other inmates than to draw the portrait of
himself in youth. We know that he was tall,
frail, clear-colored, with those wonderful dark
“Bachiler eyes” which now prove not to have
been true Bachiler eyes at all. He was shy,—with
a painful shyness which lasted throughout
his life,—but he was prouder than a cavalier.
Consciousness of intellectual power came to
him early; behind him was a long line of clean-lived
farmers whose lips, although “to caution
trained” by Quaker breeding, could speak
decisively when there was need. Poverty had
taught him that respect and sympathy for the
poor which is one of the noblest forms of class-pride.
It would have been hard to find in all
New England a country boy whose mind was
so perfectly prepared for the visitation of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>master-poet; and the poet, by some special
gift of fortune, proved to be Robert Burns.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story of that revealing experience is
familiar enough: how a “pawky” wandering
Scotchman sang “Bonny Doon” and “Highland
Mary” and “Auld Lang Syne” over his
mug of cider in the Whittier kitchen; and then
how Joshua Coffin, the boy’s first schoolmaster,
loaned him that copy of Burns which proved
to be his passport to the wonder-world:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I saw through all familiar things</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The romance underlying;</div>
      <div class='line'>The joys and griefs that plume the wings</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of Fancy skyward flying.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>He had already scribbled verses upon the
beam of his mother’s loom, and like the boy
Alfred Tennyson, only two years younger than
himself, in the far-away Lincolnshire rectory,
he had loved to fill his slate with rhymes. But
from the moment that he read Burns this boyish
delight in mere jingling sounds deepened
into a sense that he, too, might become a poet.
At sixteen he was composing with extraordinary
fluency and with considerable skill. At
eighteen he had written verses which his sister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Mary thought good enough to be printed, and
a poem which she sent surreptitiously to
William Lloyd Garrison, the twenty-year-old
editor of the “Newburyport Free Press,” was
accepted and published on June 8, 1826. This
printing of “The Exile’s Departure” in the
poet’s corner of a struggling local newspaper
was a fateful event for Whittier. Everybody
knows the instant and generous interest
aroused in the youthful editor: how he drove
out to East Haverhill, unearthed his bashful
poet,—who was at that moment crawling
under the barn after a stolen hen’s nest,—and
urged his father to give Greenleaf something
better than a district schooling. “Sir, poetry
will not give him bread!” exclaimed John
Whittier, as sternly as Carlyle’s father might
have said it. But the upshot was that the gaunt
lad got his term at the Haverhill Academy,
paying his way by making shoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>He continued to write poems in astonishing
profusion, taught school himself for a term
in his native township, then took a final term
at the Academy, and at twenty-one the ways
were parting before his feet. A scheme for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>publication of his poems by subscription had
failed. His health seemed too frail for effective
farm labor. His ignorance of the classics,
as well as his lack of funds, barred the doors
of a college course. He decided to earn his
bread by journalism, and became at the end
of his twenty-first year the editor of “The
American Manufacturer” in Boston. The
choice was significant. For three years he
had been heralded as an unlettered “poet,”
a sort of local phenomenon who was possibly
destined, as Garrison had prophesied, to rank
“among the bards of his country.” Yet here
he was, turning, with a Yankee’s shrewd facility,
to politics and affairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was led, no doubt,—as in the more
momentous crisis of 1833, when he obeyed
Garrison’s call and turned Abolitionist,—by
an instinct deeper than any conscious analysis
of his powers. He knew that he had what
he called a “knack of rhyming,” and he had
learned from Burns to find material for poetry
all about him. Yet he possessed at this time
but a scanty equipment for the long road
which a poet must travel. His physical endowment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>was impoverished. That full-blooded
life of the senses, which taught Burns and
Goethe at fourteen such secrets of human rapture
and dismay, was impossible for the
Quaker stripling. He was color-blind. His ear
barely recognized a tune. The bodily sensations
of odor, taste, and touch are scarcely to
be felt in his poetry. He was indeed “no
Greek,” as Whitman said of him long afterward;
and at the outset of his career, as at its
close, he cared but little for literature as an art.
To conceive of any of the arts as a religion, or
as an embodiment, for sense perception, of the
highest potencies of the human spirit, would
have seemed almost blasphemous to this follower
of the “inward light.” He wrote to Lucy
Hooper that a long poem, “unless consecrated
to the sacred interests of religion and humanity,
would be a criminal waste of life.” Parthenon
and Pantheon were in his eyes less significant
and memorable than Pennsylvania Hall, the
Abolitionist headquarters in Philadelphia. In
an editorial in “The Freeman” in 1838, prefacing
a reprint of “A Psalm of Life,” which
had just been published in the New York
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Knickerbocker,” Whittier declared: “It is
very seldom that we find an article of poetry
so full of excellent philosophy and <span class='fss'>COMMON
SENSE</span> as the following. We know not who
the author may be, but he or she is no common
man or woman. These nine simple verses are
worth more than all the dreams of Shelley, and
Keats, and Wordsworth. They are alive and
vigorous with the spirit of the day in which we
live—the moral steam enginery of an age of
action.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One who could utter this amazing verdict
upon the “Psalm of Life” certainly seems less
fitted for poetry than for journalism and politics:
and indeed Whittier’s aptitude for affairs,
even at twenty-one, was extraordinary. His
political editorials for the “Manufacturer”—a
Clay journal which advocated a protective
tariff—were skilfully written from the first.
Subsequent editorial engagements in Haverhill,
Hartford, and Philadelphia, although rendered
brief by his wretched health, nevertheless
widened his acquaintance and increased
his self-confidence. His judgment was canny.
His knowledge of local conditions, at first in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>his native town and county, and afterward
throughout New England and the Eastern
States, was singularly exact. He seemed to
perceive, as by some actual visualization, how
people were thinking and feeling in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and other
communities which he had observed at first
hand; and he employed a correspondingly
accurate and as it were topographical imagination
when he wrote of affairs in Kansas, Paris,
or Italy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Men were never abstractions to him. They
were concrete persons, with ambitions to be
tempted, generosities to be wakened, weaknesses
to be utilized. His own county of Essex
was then, as now, noted for the adroitness of its
politicians, but at twenty-five John Greenleaf
Whittier could beat the best of them at their
own game. He was tireless in personal persuasion,
in secret correspondence, in fighting fire
with fire. He read Burke, and was prompt to
apply Burke’s principle: “When bad men combine,
the good should associate.” A Whig himself
until the formation of the Liberty party, he
was willing, as his friend Garrison was not, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>compromise on non-essentials for the sake of
bringing things to pass. The hand of a master
is revealed in his published letters to Caleb
Cushing and to Henry Clay. It was he who
devised the coalitions which sent Cushing, the
Whig, and Rantoul, the Democrat, to Congress,
which made Boutwell governor of Massachusetts
and sent Sumner to the United States
Senate. When Sumner was struck down in the
Senate chamber and his indignant constituents
held mass meetings to voice their horror, Whittier
was self-controlled enough to declare: “It
seems to me to be no time for the indulgence of
mere emotions.... The North is not united
for freedom as the South is for slavery....
We must forget, <i>forgive</i>, and <span class='fss'>UNITE</span>.” No utterance
could be more characteristic of the
man. In public affairs he knew what he
wanted to compass, and he was as willing to
lobby or to trade votes as to write an editorial
or a lyric, provided the good cause could be
thereby made to prosper. Extremists thought
that he yielded to considerations of mere expediency;
but his was rather the versatility of
the born political fighter, who can use more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>weapons than one. Underneath all questions of
policy, lay his inherited democratic sympathy
with the ordinary man. At the height of his fame
he loved to sit upon a cracker barrel in the grocery
store at Amesbury, and talk politics. “I
am a <i>man</i>,” he wrote to his biographer Underwood
in 1883, “and not a mere verse-maker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This glimpse at the later revelations of his
character is essential to an understanding of
the spiritual crisis which confronted him in
1833, when he was only twenty-six. He loved
power, and had already exercised it in the congenial
field of politics. The road to preferment
lay that way. It is true that he had continued
to compose abundantly, both in prose and in
verse. His writings were favorably noticed.
Yet he saw no career for himself as a man of
letters. “I have done with poetry and literature,”
he wrote to a friend in 1832. Repeated
disappointments in love had darkened his
spirit. The death of his father had forced him
back to the old farm to support his mother and
sisters. Black care sat very close behind him.
Discouraged, lonely, with ambitions ungratified
and great powers of which he was but half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>aware, he paused, like some knight who had
lost his way in an enchanted forest. Then
blew the clear unmistakable trumpet call which
broke the spell and summoned him to action.
Although an anti-slavery man by native instinct,
Whittier had never given his adherence
to the sect of Abolitionists. Now came a letter
from Garrison (March 22, 1833): “My brother,
there are upwards of two million of our
countrymen who are doomed to the most horrible
servitude which ever cursed our race and
blackened the page of history. There are one
hundred thousand of their offspring kidnapped
annually from their birth. The southern portion
of our country is going down to destruction,
physically and morally, with a swift
descent, carrying other portions with her.
This, then, is a time for the philanthropist—any
friend of his country, to put forth his energies,
in order to let the oppressed go free, and
sustain the republic. The cause is worthy of
Gabriel—yea, the God of hosts places himself
at its head. Whittier, enlist! Your
talents, zeal, influence—all are needed.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The spirit of Burns, years before, had whispered
to the boy that he, too, had the poet-soul,
yet facile versifying was all that had seemed to
come of it, and the young man had turned
to politics. Now the living voice of Garrison
called him away from partisan ambitions to
enlist in a doubtful and perilous measure of
moral reform. He obeyed, and—so strange
are the mysteries of personality—found in that
new service to humanity not only the inspiration
which made him a genuine poet, but the
popular recognition which set the seal upon his
fame.</p>

<p class='c011'>The immediate cost of obedience to his conscience
was heavy. The generation of Americans
born since the Civil War look back upon
the Abolitionists as victors after thirty years
of agitation, as the dictators of national policy.
Their statues are in public places. Their theories
have prevailed. But in the early thirties
they suffered such ostracism and even martyrdom
as only a few historical students now
realize. Churches, colleges, and courts were
against them, for reasons which were adequate
enough. They were dangerous members of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>society. To-day we endeavor to exclude
Anarchists from American soil; the leading
Abolitionists, like the Russian Revolutionists
of the present hour, preached Anarchy in the
name of Humanity. Whittier, trained to quietism,
non-resistance, and respect for law, and
skilled as he had become in feeling the pulse
of public opinion, knew perfectly well what
company he was henceforth to keep. To be an
active Abolitionist was to join the outcasts.</p>

<p class='c011'>His first act of allegiance was to write and
publish at his own expense a pamphlet entitled
“Justice and Expediency,” which pleaded for
immediate emancipation by peaceful means.
In December, 1833, he was a delegate from
Massachusetts at the founding in Philadelphia
of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Whittier
was the youngest member. Thirty years
later he wrote to Garrison, who had been his
companion upon that memorable journey:
“I am not insensible to literary reputation. I
love, perhaps too well, the praise and good-will
of my fellow-men; but I set a higher value on
my name as appended to the Anti-Slavery
Declaration of 1833 than on the title-page of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>any book.” No words could better illustrate
his devotion to the cause of the slave. Yet he
did not surrender his right of private judgment
as to the best means to be employed. Garrison
lost patience, ere long, with Whittier’s willingness
to further the cause by compromise and
concession, and the friends parted, to come
together again in later years. The movement
for emancipation needed both men and both
methods; but Whittier’s method—less heroic
than Garrison’s, less intolerant than Sumner’s,
less virulent than that of Wendell Phillips—was
like Abraham Lincoln’s in its patience,
shrewdness, and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whittier faced hostile mobs with perfect
courage, and with a touch of the humor which
is rarely revealed in his writings. When the
Philadelphia rioters looted and burned Pennsylvania
Hall, he disguised himself in a wig
and long white overcoat, mingled with the
mob, and saved his own editorial papers. He
brought not only courage and finesse, but
high journalistic skill, to the service of the
Abolitionists. His pamphlets, his editorials
in the “Freeman,” “Middlesex Standard,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“National Era,” and other newspapers, were
trenchant, caustic, and far-sighted. Invalidism
and the care of his mother’s family kept him
almost constantly at Amesbury, whither he
had removed after the sale of his birthplace
in 1836. But Whittier’s was no home-keeping
mind, and there is scarcely a political event of
importance, either in this country or abroad,
which is not reflected in his prose and verse
produced during the thirty years ending with
the close of the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet his chief function during the long anti-slavery
struggle was that of chartered poet
to the cause. No sooner had he abandoned
his dream of personal advancement than the
Byronic melancholy, the weak imitations of
Scott, and the echoes of Mrs. Felicia Hemans
disappear from his verse. He was studying the
prose of Milton and Burke, those organ-voices
of English liberty. From Burns and Byron he
now caught only the passion for justice and the
common rights of all. He forgot himself. He
forgot, for the time being, those pleasant themes
of New England legend and history, which
earlier and later touched his meditative fancy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The cause of negro emancipation in America—to
his mind only one phase of the struggle
for a wider human freedom everywhere—stirred
and deepened his whole nature. There
is scarcely a type of political and social verse
which is not represented in his work during
this period. He wrote personal lyrics in praise
of living leaders, and mournful salutes to the
dead; hymns to be sung in churches, and campaign
songs for the town hall. The touching
lines to “Randolph of Roanoke” are a
knightly tribute to an opponent. The generous
and noble “Lost Occasion” was written after
Webster’s death to supplement, rather than to
retract, the terrific “Ichabod” addressed to
Webster after his defence of the Fugitive Slave
Law. Not since Burns had any poet dared
pillory the clergy in such derisive and indignant
strains as marked “Clerical Oppressors,”
“The Pastoral Letter,” and “A Sabbath
Scene.” The selfishness of commercialism,
and its “paltry pedler cries” which exalt
“banks” and “tariffs” above the man, have
never been arraigned more powerfully than
in “The Pine-Tree” and “Moloch in State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Street.” Such poems are class and party verse
of the purest type.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whittier’s direct contact with the soil and
his intense interest in localities made him
also an unequalled interpreter of sectional
feeling. “Massachusetts to Virginia” is perhaps
the finest example of this sort of political
verse, but he wrote many similar poems
hardly less striking; and such was the flexibility
of Whittier’s imagination when inspired
by the common cause that he expressed not
only the mood of the New England but also
of the Middle States, and of that “Wild
West,” as he called it, which was so soon
to combine with his “roused North.” Much
of this political poetry was, in the nature
of the case, only a sort of rhymed oratory,
scarcely differing, save in rhetorical and metrical
structure, from the speeches of Beecher
and Wendell Phillips. Sometimes it was
rhymed journalism, of the kind which Greeley
was using in his sturdy iterative editorials.
Much of it, no doubt, has already met the
oblivion which attends most pamphlets or
stanzas “for the times.” Harshness of tone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>over-severity in judgment of men and measures,
diffuseness of style, a faulty ear for
rhymes, are frequently in evidence. Yet these
blemishes scarcely affected the immediate
value of Whittier’s verse for controversial purposes.
Its faults of taste and form were rightly
forgotten in its communicative energy of emotion,
its lambent scorn of evil things, its
prophet-like exaltation. Long before armed
conflict ended the debate, Whittier’s poetry
had won the attention not only of his section,
but of the entire North, and as the conflict
proceeded his verse sounded more and more
clearly that national note which had been the
burden of the great and maligned Webster’s
speeches for union. Only now it was to be a
union redeemed. We must be “first pure, then
peaceable,” the Quaker poet had maintained,
and the fine close of his ballad “Barbara Frietchie,”
like his “Laus Deo” which “sang itself”
in church while the bells were ringing to celebrate
the passing of slavery, is echoed to-day
in the hearts of true Americans everywhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>To study the chronological order of his
poems from “The Exile’s Departure,” written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in 1825, to “Snow-Bound,” written just forty
years later, is to watch the steady broadening
and clarifying of Whittier’s spirit. He found
in the community of emotion wrought by a
moral and political crisis the secret of command
over his own nature and over the modes
of poetic expression. By 1840 the worst hour
of persecution for the Abolitionists was already
past. There were no more mobs for Whittier
to face. He remained, for the most part,
quietly at Amesbury. In 1845 he began to
contribute the spirited “Songs of Labor” to
the “Democratic Review,” thus antedating
Whitman by ten years in celebrating the
American workingman. By 1847, in the
“Proem” written to introduce the first general
collection of his poems, he has already learned
to regard himself as a singer whose nature
inclined him to the “old melodious lays” of
Spenser and Sidney, although his lot had
fallen in stormy times:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“The rigor of a frozen clime,</div>
      <div class='line'>The harshness of an untaught ear,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>The jarring words of one whose rhyme</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Beat often Labor’s hurried time,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Duty’s rugged march through storm and strife, are here.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>He does not regret his choice, but there is
some yearning over the lost Arcady. In the
enforced leisure of his frequent invalidism
Whittier read very widely, and legend and
dreamy fancy alternate in his verse with
satirical invective and eloquent humanitarianism.
The tragic “Ichabod” and the mordant
irony of “A Sabbath Scene” are followed by
the charming lines “To My Old Schoolmaster.”
The poem on Burns, so fresh with “the
dews of boyhood’s morning,” and the ballad
of “Maud Muller,” where the pathos of our
human “might have been” is expressed with
such artless adequacy, date from the thrilling
year of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill. The Kansas
emigrants were actually singing</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We cross the prairie as of old</div>
      <div class='line'>The Pilgrims crossed the sea”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>while Whittier was writing “The Barefoot
Boy” in 1855. The “Burial of Barber” is succeeded
by “Mary Garvin.” After the storm,
come the bird voices.</p>

<p class='c011'>When “The Atlantic Monthly” was founded
in 1857, Whittier contributed to its early numbers,
not his timely and impassioned “Moloch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>in State Street” and “Le Marais du Cygne,”
but rather “The Gift of Tritemius,” “Skipper
Ireson’s Ride,” and “Telling the Bees.” In
other words, it was as a man of letters and
not as a controversialist that he joined this
distinguished company of fellow contributors.
Whittier was just turning fifty, in that year.
The hair was thin above his noticeably high
forehead; his face and figure spare as in
youth; his deep-set dark eyes still aglow; the
lips clean-shaven, nervous, resolute. Like
another invalid, he was destined to long life,
but of the thirty-five years then remaining to
him, the succeeding ten were the most fruitful.
Aside from those poems, already mentioned,
inspired by the course and outcome of
the War for the Union, his most characteristic
productions during this decade are suggested
by such titles as “My Psalm,” “My Playmate,”
“The River Path,” “Cobbler Keezar’s
Vision,” “Mountain Pictures,” “Andrew Rykman’s
Prayer,” and “The Eternal Goodness.”
These are grave, sweet, quiet poems, devout
and consolatory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whittier’s mother died in 1857, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>favorite sister, the gifted Elizabeth, in 1864,
thus leaving the Amesbury house desolate.
The poet’s memories of his birthplace, only
six miles away, but now in other hands, grew
increasingly tender in his new loneliness, and
he set himself to sketch, in an idyl longer
than it was his wont to write, the scenes and
persons dearest to his boyhood. “A homely
picture of old New England homes,” he called
it in a note to Fields, his friendly publisher.
The poem was “Snow-Bound,” and it proved
at once to be what it has since remained, the
most popular of his productions; notable, not
so much for sensuous beauty or for any fresh
range of thought, as for its vividness, its fidelity
of homely detail, its unerring feeling for
the sentiment of the hearthside.</p>

<p class='c011'>The surprising profits of “Snow-Bound”
made Whittier—to whom, as he himself said,
the doors of magazines and publishing houses
had been shut for twenty years of his life—a
well-to-do man henceforward. He never
married. But he prided himself upon never
losing a friend, and many homes were graciously
offered to him in his old age. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the marriage of his niece in 1876, he became
for a large part of each year the guest of his
cousins at Oak Knoll, Danvers. In this stately
and beautiful home, and in many friendly
houses in Boston, he met frequently some of
the best men and women of his time. His relations
with the chief American authors of his
day were cordial, although scarcely intimate.
Most of them gathered in honor of his seventieth
birthday at a dinner given by the publishers
of “The Atlantic,” and the subsequent
anniversaries of his birth were very generally
noticed. But his life was essentially a solitary
one. Professor Carpenter has noted in his
admirable study of Whittier that his most
familiar acquaintances and correspondents, in
his later life, were women. “In old age his was
the point of view, the theory of life, of the
woman of gentle tastes, literary interests, and
religious feeling. The best accounts of his
later life are those of Mrs. Claflin and Mrs.
Fields, in whose houses he was often a guest;
and they have much to say of his sincere friendliness
and quiet talk, his shy avoidance of
notoriety or even of a large group of people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>his keen sense of humor, his tales of his youth,
his quaintly serious comments on life, his sudden
comings and goings as inclination moved,
and of the rare occasions when, deeply moved,
he spoke of the great issues of religion with
beautiful earnestness and simple faith. And
it is pleasant to think of this farmer’s lad, who
had lived for forty years in all but poverty for
the love of God and his fellows, taking an
innocent delight in the luxury of great houses
and in the sheltered life of those protected
from hardship and privation. After his long
warfare this was a just reward.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>After the publication of “Snow-Bound” in
1866, Whittier composed nearly two hundred
poems. They celebrate some of his friendships,
and indicate the variety of his reading
and his interest in progress both in this country
and in Europe. They describe, with loving
accuracy, the mountains, streams, and shore
of New Hampshire, where he usually made
his summer pilgrimages. But few of these later
poems, pleasant reading as they are, affect
materially one’s estimate of Whittier’s poetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>powers. His real work was done. Here and
there, and notably in the idyl “The Pennsylvania
Pilgrim,” there is a grace and ripeness
which indicate the Indian Summer of his art,
with lovely lines written for the “wise angels”
rather than for discordant men. One thinks
with a sigh of his description of himself in “The
Tent on the Beach”:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And one there was, a dreamer born,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who, with a mission to fulfil,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had left the Muses’ haunts to turn</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The crank of an opinion-mill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But regrets that he could not have lingered
in dream-land are doubly futile; for it was the
opinion-mill, after all, that made Whittier a
poet. Life taught him deeper secrets than
bookish ease could ever have imparted. “The
simple fact is,” he wrote to E. L. Godkin,
“that I cannot be sufficiently grateful to the
Divine Providence that so early called my attention
to the great interests of humanity,
saving me from the poor ambitions and miserable
jealousies of a selfish pursuit of literary
reputation.” These words might have been
written by one of the saints, and such, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>very truth, was Whittier. Poverty, chastity, and
obedience were his portion in this life. By the
road of renunciation he entered into his spiritual
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not one of the royally endowed, far-shining,
“myriad-minded” poets. He was rustic,
provincial; a man of his place and time in
America. It is doubtful if European readers
will ever find him richly suggestive, as they
have found Emerson, Poe, and Whitman. But
he had a tenacious hold upon certain realities:
first, upon the soil of New England, of whose
history and legend he became such a sympathetic
interpreter; next, upon “the good old
cause” of freedom, not only in his own country
but in all places where the age-long and
still but half-won battle was being waged; and
finally, upon some permanent objects of human
emotion,—the hill-top, shore and sky,
the fireside, the troubled heart that seeks rest
in God. Whittier’s poetry has revealed to
countless readers the patient continuity of human
life, its fundamental unity, and the ultimate
peace that hushes its discords. The utter
simplicity of his Quaker’s creed has helped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>him to interpret the religious mood of a generation
which has grown impatient of formal
doctrine. His hymns are sung by almost every
body of Christians, the world over. It is unlikely
that the plain old man who passed
quietly away in a New Hampshire village on
September 7, 1892, aged eighty-five, will ever
be reckoned one of the world-poets. But he
was, in the best sense of the word, a world’s-man
in heart and in action, a sincere and noble
soul who hated whatever was evil and helped
to make the good prevail; and his verse, fiery
and tender and unfeigned, will long be cherished
by his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. A remarkable custom, brought from the Old Country, formerly
prevailed in the rural districts of New England. On the death of a
member of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event,
and their hives dressed in mourning. This ceremonial was supposed
to be necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and
seeking a new home.—<span class='sc'>Whittier.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. In the valuable and carefully prepared <cite>History of Marblehead</cite>,
published in 1879 by Samuel Roads, Jr., it is stated that the crew of
Captain Ireson, rather than himself, were responsible for the abandonment
of the disabled vessel. To screen themselves they charged
their captain with the crime. In view of this the writer of the ballad
addressed the following letter to the historian:</p>

<div class='c016'><span class='sc'>Oak Knoll, Danvers</span>, <i>5 mo. 18, 1880</i>.</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>My dear Friend</span>; I heartily thank thee for a copy of thy <cite>History
of Marblehead</cite>. I have read it with great interest and think good use
has been made of the abundant material. No town in Essex County
has a record more honorable than Marblehead; no one has done more
to develop the industrial interests of our New England seaboard, and
certainly none have given such evidence of self-sacrificing patriotism.
I am glad the story of it has been at last told, and told so well. I have
now no doubt that thy version of Skipper Ireson’s ride is the correct
one. My verse was founded solely on a fragment of rhyme which
I heard from one of my early schoolmates, a native of Marblehead.</p>

<p class='c017'>I supposed the story to which it referred dated back at least a century.
I knew nothing of the participators, and the narrative of the
ballad was pure fancy. I am glad for the sake of truth and justice
that the real facts are given in thy book. I certainly would not knowingly
do injustice to any one, dead or living.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The recollection of some descendants of a Hessian deserter in
the Revolutionary war bearing the name of Muller doubtless suggested
the somewhat infelicitous title of a New England idyl. The
poem had no real foundation in fact, though a hint of it may have been
found in recalling an incident, trivial in itself, of a journey on the picturesque
Maine seaboard with my sister some years before it was
written. We had stopped to rest our tired horse under the shade of an
apple-tree, and refresh him with water from a little brook which rippled
through the stone wall across the road. A very beautiful young
girl in scantest summer attire was at work in the hay-field, and as we
talked with her we noticed that she strove to hide her bare feet by
raking hay over them, blushing as she did so, through the tan of her
cheek and neck.—<span class='sc'>Whittier.</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Though not published until 1847, several lines indicate that the
poem was written not long after Randolph’s death in 1833. In a letter
published in July, 1833, Whittier says: “In the last hour of his [Randolph’s]
existence, when his soul was struggling from its broken tenement,
his latest effort was the confirmation of this generous act of a
former period [the manumission of his slaves]. Light rest the turf upon
him, beneath his patrimonial oaks! The prayers of many hearts made
happy by his benevolence shall linger over his grave and bless it.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. Written on reading an account of the proceedings of the citizens
of Norfolk, Va., in reference to George Latimer, the alleged fugitive
slave, who was seized in Boston without warrant at the request of
James B. Grey, of Norfolk, claiming to be his master. The case
caused great excitement North and South, and led to the presentation
of a petition to Congress, signed by more than fifty thousand citizens
of Massachusetts, calling for such laws and proposed amendments
to the Constitution as should relieve the Commonwealth from all
further participation in the crime of oppression. George Latimer
himself was finally given free papers for the sum of four hundred
dollars.—<span class='sc'>Whittier.</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Written on hearing that the Anti-Slavery Resolves of Stephen C.
Phillips had been rejected by the Whig Convention in Faneuil Hall,
in 1846.—<span class='sc'>Whittier.</span></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. This poem was the outcome of the surprise and grief and forecast
of evil consequences which I felt on reading the seventh of March
speech of Daniel Webster in support of the “compromise,” and the
Fugitive Slave Law. No partisan or personal enmity dictated it. On
the contrary my admiration of the splendid personality and intellectual
power of the great Senator was never stronger than when I laid down
his speech, and, in one of the saddest moments of my life, penned my
protest. I saw, as I wrote, with painful clearness its sure results,—the
Slave Power arrogant and defiant, strengthened and encouraged to
carry out its scheme for the extension of its baleful system, or the dissolution
of the Union, the guaranties of personal liberty in the free
States broken down, and the whole country made the hunting-ground
of slave-catchers. In the horror of such a vision, so soon fearfully fulfilled,
if one spoke at all, he could only speak in tones of stern and
sorrowful rebuke.</p>

<p class='c011'>But death softens all resentments, and the consciousness of a common
inheritance of frailty and weakness modifies the severity of judgment.
Years after, in <cite>The Lost Occasion</cite>, I gave utterance to an almost
universal regret that the great statesman did not live to see the flag
which he loved trampled under the feet of Slavery, and, in view of this
desecration, make his last days glorious in defence of “Liberty and
Union, one and inseparable.”—<span class='sc'>Whittier.</span></p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. This poem was written in strict conformity to the account of the
incident as I had it from respectable and trustworthy sources. It has
since been the subject of a good deal of conflicting testimony, and the
story was probably incorrect in some of its details. It is admitted by
all that Barbara Frietchie was no myth, but a worthy and highly
esteemed gentlewoman, intensely loyal and a hater of the Slavery
Rebellion, holding her Union flag sacred and keeping it with her
Bible; that when the Confederates halted before her house, and
entered her dooryard, she denounced them in vigorous language,
shook her cane in their faces, and drove them out; and when General
Burnside’s troops followed close upon Jackson’s, she waved her flag
and cheered them. It is stated that May Quantrell, a brave and loyal
lady in another part of the city, did wave her flag in sight of the
Confederates. It is possible that there has been a blending of the two
incidents.—<span class='sc'>Whittier.</span></p>

amendment abolishing slavery. The resolution was adopted by Congress,
January 31, 1865. The ratification by the requisite number of
States was announced December 18, 1865. [The suggestion came to
the poet as he sat in the Friends’ Meeting-house in Amesbury, where
he was present at the regular Fifth-day meeting. All sat in silence,
but on his return to his home, he recited a portion of the poem, not
yet committed to paper, to his housemates in the garden room. “It
wrote itself, or rather sang itself, while the bells rang,” he wrote to
Lucy Larcom.]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. Recited by one of the little group of relations, who stood by the
poet’s bedside, as the last moment of his life approached.</p>
